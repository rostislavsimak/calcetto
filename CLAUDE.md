# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Team-splitter tool for a weekly 5-a-side football ("calcetto") game, Italian-language UI.

- `calcetto-squadre.html` — standalone browser app (React + Babel classic-runtime inline via CDN, no build) with the "Stadio di Notte" dark-stadium skin (Barlow Condensed, floodlight vignette, pitch-line watermark). Uses `localStorage` for persistence. The JSX lives in a `text/plain` script tag compiled manually with `runtime: "classic"` — Babel's default automatic runtime emits an ES `import` that breaks without a bundler.

Storage keys: `calcetto-roster` (permanent roster; guests filtered out before writing) and `calcetto-history` (last 30 saved formations).

No build tooling, no package.json, no test runner. To syntax-check after edits: compile the JSX with `@babel/standalone` in node.

## Architecture

- **Splitting algorithm** (`allSplits`, `bestBalancedSplits`): brute-force enumerates every two-group split of present players (anchoring `players[0]` in group A to skip mirrored duplicates), scores by absolute rating-sum difference, pools all splits within `minDiff` (widening +1 if fewer than 4 candidates). A secondary goalkeeper criterion then narrows *within* that pool: each player has `gkLevel` (`good`/`average`/`poor` → weight 2/1/0, missing field reads as `average`), and the pool is restricted to minimal `|gkSumA − gkSumB|` with the same ≥4-candidates widening. Rating balance is never violated by the gk pass; all-average rosters behave exactly as the pre-gk algorithm.
- **`App`**: owns all state (roster, `presentIds`, draw `result`, `history`). Persists roster on change (guests with `isGuest: true` are filtered out, so they vanish on reload); history is written only by the explicit `saveFormation` action (max 30 records). Three tabs: `MatchView` ("Oggi"), `RosterView` ("Rosa"), `HistoryView` ("Storico").
- **`runDraw(excludeLast)`**: random pick from the balanced pool; `excludeLast` filters out the currently-shown split on reshuffle. Runs a ~10-tick 90ms flicker animation via `spinRef` before settling.
- **`swapInResult(idA, idB)`**: post-draw manual correction — swaps one player from each team inside `result` only (pool/history untouched), recomputing sums. Driven by chip selection in the TeamCards (select one, tap one on the opposite team).
- **`RosterView`**: add/remove players, 1–10 rating in half-point steps (slider + typed input via `clampRating`, accepts comma decimals), gk aptitude picker, presence counter derived on the fly from history.
- **`MatchView`**: presence toggles with search filter (Enter toggles first match), one-night guest form, draw trigger, "Salva formazione" button, TeamCards.
- **Share card** (`drawFormationCard` + helpers): 1080×1350 canvas image of the formation on a stylized pitch (striped grass, boxes, center circle, header with Italian date, Rossa/Blu labels). **No numeric data on the shared image or fallback text** — no player ratings, no team averages/scores; names, team labels, title and date only (the on-screen TeamCards keep showing rating/media, the constraint is share-only). Player placement is purely aesthetic — `layoutRows(n)` depends only on head count (rows = ⌈√n⌉, spread evenly), never on rating/gkLevel; blue half is mirrored. Palette hardcoded in `CARD_C` (canvas can't read CSS vars); waits on `document.fonts.ready` before drawing. "Condividi" opens a preview modal → `navigator.canShare({files})` native sheet → PNG download fallback → clipboard text fallback; in a sandboxed host the preview itself is the last-resort (manual screenshot).

State flow is one-directional and local to `App` — no external state management, no routing, no network calls beyond storage.

## Post-match voting

No backend: voting is round-tripped through WhatsApp text, not a server. `saveFormation` stamps each history record with a `matchId` (`uid()`); `HistoryView` per-record actions:

- **"Genera link voto"** (`VoteLinkModal`) — `buildVoteLink` base64url-encodes `{matchId, date, players: [{id, name}]}` (both teams) into `?vote=…` on the page's own URL. Only works once the file is actually hosted (not `file://`) since it has to be opened from other players' phones.
- Opening the app with `?vote=…` short-circuits `Root` straight to `VotePage`, bypassing `App`/localStorage entirely — a self-contained "who are you → rate your teammates → send" flow. Each teammate gets a 5-way relative choice (−1 / −0.5 / unchanged / +0.5 / +1), deliberately relative-to-tonight rather than an absolute 1–10 re-rating, since relative deltas self-anchor to each voter's own baseline and are less sensitive to raters using different scales. On submit it builds a compact code `CLC1|<matchId>|<voterId>|<playerId>:<delta>,…` (delta in half-point units, -2..2) and hands it to `navigator.share` (falls back to a `wa.me` intent, then a manual copy button) so the voter sends it back to the organizer over WhatsApp.
- **"Conta voti"** (`TallyModal`) — organizer pastes whatever WhatsApp messages came back (in any order, with any surrounding text); `parseVoteCodes` regex-scans for `CLC1|…` blocks matching the record's `matchId`, dedupes by voter (last write wins), and `tallyVotes` averages deltas per player. Suggested new rating (`clampRating(current + avgDelta * 0.5, current)`) is shown next to the current one — **nothing is written back automatically**, the organizer updates ratings by hand in Rosa.

History records saved before this feature lack `matchId`, so they don't show the vote buttons.
